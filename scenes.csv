"INT. PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION AREA - DAY

It's grand and modern.  Random House-Knopf-Taschen is etched
on the wall in large gold letters.  An old woman enters
carrying a tattered manuscript, maybe a thousand pages.  She
seems haunted, hollow-eyed, sickly.  The young receptionist,
dressed in a shiny, stretchy one-piece pantsuit, looks up.

		RECEPTIONIST
	Oh, hi.

		OLD WOMAN
		(apologetically)
	Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought
	I'd see --

		RECEPTIONIST
	I think he's in a conference.
	Unfortunately.  I'm really sorry.

		OLD WOMAN
	Would you just try him?  You never know.
	As long as I'm here.  You never know.

		RECEPTIONIST
	Of course.  Please have a seat.

The old woman smiles and sits, the bulky manuscript on her
lap.  She stares politely straight ahead.

		RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
		(quietly into headset)
	It's her -- I know, but couldn't you just
	-- Yes, I know, but -- I know, but she's
	old and it would be a nice -- Yes, sorry.
		(to old woman)
	I'm sorry, ma'am, he's not in right now.
	It's a crazy time of year for us.

The receptionist gestures toward a Christmas tree in the
corner.  Its ornaments are holograms.

		OLD WOMAN
	This book -- It's essential that people
	read it because --
		(gravely, patting the
		 manuscript)
	-- It's the truth.  And only I know it.

		RECEPTIONIST
		(nodding sympathetically)
	Maybe after the holidays then.","An old woman walks into a grand and modern publishing house carrying a tattered manuscript that seems to be about a thousand pages long. She appears haunted, hollow-eyed, and sickly. The receptionist greets her and tells her that the person she wants to see is in a conference and asks if she would like to wait. The old woman agrees and sits down with the manuscript on her lap. The receptionist talks to someone on her headset, referring to the old woman. The old woman insists that it is essential for people to read her book as it tells the truth and only she knows it. The receptionist nods in sympathy and suggests that the old woman come back after the holidays. The scene is set during the Christmas season as a hologram tree is seen in the background."
"INT. TILED HALLWAY - DAY

The old woman carries her manuscript haltingly down a subway
hall.  She stops to catch her breath, then continues and
passes several archway with letters printed above them.  When
she arrives at one topped by an LL, she slips a card in a
slot.  A plastic molded chair drops into the archway.  She
sits in the chair; it rises.","In this scene, an old woman is carrying a manuscript down a subway hallway. As she walks, she stops to catch her breath, and then continues moving. She passes several archways that have letters printed above them. When she reaches one with the letters ""LL"" on top, she inserts a card in a slot, causing a plastic chair to drop down into the archway. She sits in the chair, and it begins to rise."
"INT. TUBE -DAY

The woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into a
line of chairs shooting through a glass tube.  The other
chairs are peopled with commuters.  We stay with the woman as
she and the others travel over New York City in the tube.
There are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the
skyline.  The woman glances at the manuscript in her lap.
It's called:

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

This serves as the movie's opening title.  The other credits
follow, as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes.
Their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank.","The scene opens with a woman sitting in a chair as it moves into a line of chairs in a tube. The tube is filled with commuters and they travel over New York City. The woman looks at a manuscript in her lap titled ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". This serves as the opening title for the movie, followed by additional credits. The woman, an old lady, observes the faces of other commuters as they pass by in their own tubes, noticing that they appear harsh, sad, lonely, and blank."
"INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

SUBTITLED: FIFTY YEARS EARLIER

Every doctor's office waiting room: chairs against the wall,
magazines on end tables, a sad-looking potted plant, generic
seascape paintings on the walls.  The receptionist, Mary, 25,
can be seen typing in the reception area.  Behind her are
shelves and shelves of medical files.  The door opens and
Clementine enters.  She's in her early thirties, zaftig in a
faux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt.  She's
decidedly funky and has blue hair.  Mary looks up.

		MARY
	May I help you?

		CLEMENTINE
		(approaching reception area)
	Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr.
	Mierzwiak.  Clementine Kruczynski.

		MARY
	Yes, please have a seat.  He'll be right
	with you.

Clementine sits.  She looks tired, maybe hungover.  She picks
up a magazine at random and thumbs without interest.","In this scene, Clementine enters a typical doctor's office waiting room for her appointment with Dr. Mierzwiak. The setting is fifty years earlier than the present day shown in the rest of the film. The receptionist, Mary, checks her in and Clementine sits down to wait. She looks tired and disinterested as she flips through a magazine. Clementine's style stands out with her funky clothing and blue hair."
"INT. INNER OFFICE AREA - CONTINUOUS

Mary pads down the hallway.  She knocks on a closed door.

		MIERZWIAK (O.S.)
	Yes?

Mary opens the door, peeks in.  Howard Mierzwiak, 40's,
professional, dry, sits behind his desk studying some papers.

		MARY
	Howard, your one o'clock.

		MIERZWIAK
		(not looking up)
	Thanks, Mary.  You can bring her in.

She smiles and nods.  It's clear she's in love.  It's equally
clear that Mierzwiak doesn't have a clue.  Mary turns to
leave.

		MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
		(looking up)
	Mary...

		MARY
		(turning back)
	Yes?

		MIERZWIAK
	Order me a pastrami for after?

		MARY
	Cole slaw, ice tea?

		MIERZWIAK
		(nodding)
	Thanks.

		MARY
	Welcome, Howard.

She smiles and heads down the hall.  Stan, 30's, tall,
spindly, and earnest in a lab coat pops out of a doorway.

		STAN
	Boo.

		MARY
	Hi.

She glances back nervously at Mierzwiak's open door.

		STAN
	Barely seen you all morning, kiddo.

He leans in to kiss her.  She cranes her neck to keep him
off.

		MARY
		(reprimanding whisper)
	Stan... c'mon...

		STAN
	Sorry.  I just --

		MARY
		(somewhat guiltilly)
	It's just...y'know... I mean...

		STAN
	I know.  Anyway --

		MARY
	Anyway, I've got to do my tap
	dance here.

She indicates the door to the reception area.  Stan nods.

		STAN
	See you later, alligator.

		MARY
	'kay.

		STAN
	Hey, if you're ordering lunch for
	Mierzwiak, would you --

		MARY
	I better do this, Stan.

Stan nods again and Mary opens the door to the waiting room.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Ms. Kruczynski?

		CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
	Hi.

After a moment, Clementine appears in the doorway.  Mary
leads her down the hall, not looking back.

		MARY
		(professionally courteous)
	How are you today?

		CLEMENTINE
	Okay, I guess.

		MARY
		(at Mierzwiak's office)
	Here we are.

Mierzwiak steps out from behind his desk.

		MIERZWIAK
	Ms. Kruczynski, please come in.

Clementine enters the office.  Mary smiles at Mierzwiak and
closes the door, leaving them alone.","Mary, a receptionist, walks down a hallway to Howard Mierzwiak's office. She announces a visitor, Clementine. After ordering Mierzwiak lunch, Mary leaves as Clementine enters the office to speak with Mierzwiak."
"INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Mierzwiak directs Clementine to a chair next to a coffee
table and a conspicuously placed box of tissues.  Mierzwiak
sits across from her.  He smiles.

		MIERZWIAK
	How are you today?

		CLEMENTINE
	Okay, I guess.

		MIERZWIAK
		(nodding sympathetically)
	Well, why don't you tell me what's going
	on?  Do you mind if I turn this on?

He indicates a tape recorder.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't care.

He turns it on, smiles at her, gestures for her to begin.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Well, I've been having a bad time of it
	with um, my boyfriend, I guess.

		MIERZWIAK
	You guess he's your boyfriend?  Or you
	guess you're having a bad time with hm?

		CLEMENTINE
	What?  No.  I don't like the term
	boyfriend.  It's so gay.

Mierzwiak nods.  He's attentive, pleasant, and neutral
throughout.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Maybe gay isn't the right word.  But,
	anyway, it's been rough with him...
	whatever the fuck he is.  Heheh.  My
	significant other... heh heh.  And I
	guess on a certain level, I want to break
	it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like
	this constant questioning and re
	questioning.  Do I end it?  Should I give
	it more time?  I'm not happy, but what do
	I expect?  Relationships require work.
	You know the drill.  The thing that I
	keep coming back to is, I'm not getting
	any younger, I want to have a baby... at
	some point... maybe... right?  So then I
	think I should settle -- which is not
	necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's
	a good guy.  It's not really settling.
	Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of
	movies, y'know?  That I have some
	completely unrealistic notion of what a
	relationship can be.  But then I think,
	no, this is what I really want, so I
	should allow myself the freedom to go out
	and fucking find it.  You know?  Agreed?
	But then I think he is a good guy and...
	It's complicated.  Y'know?

		MIERZWIAK
	I think I know. I think we can help.  Why
	don't you start by telling me about your
	relationship.  Everything you can think
	of.  Everything about him.  Everything
	about you.  And we'll take it from there.

She nods, thinks.

		CLEMENTINE
	Um, well, he's a fucking tidy one --","In this scene, Clementine comes to Mierzwiak's office to talk about her relationship problems. Mierzwiak, an expert, listens to her attentively and records the conversation. Clementine expresses her confusion and frustration with her boyfriend or ""significant other"". She admits to not being happy in the relationship and questioning whether she should continue or end it. She also talks about wanting to have a baby and the pressure she feels to settle down. Mierzwiak attempts to help by asking Clementine to give him more details about her relationship with her boyfriend."
"EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION

SUBTITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER

The platform is crowded with business commuters.  Joel is
among them.  He is in his 30's, gaunt, and holding a
briefcase.  The platform across the tracks from him is empty.
Suddenly he turns and makes his way through the crowd.  He
climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass to the empty
platform.  Soon an almost empty train pulls up to that
platform.  Joel gets on and watches the business commuters
through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the
station.","Two weeks after erasing the memory of his ex-girlfriend, Clementine, Joel is seen among a crowded train station waiting for his commute. He looks frail and is carrying a briefcase. When the platform across the tracks becomes empty, he makes his way through the crowd and crosses the overpass to that platform. Once there, he gets on an almost empty train and watches the remaining commuters through a dirty window as his train departs the station."
"EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION - LATER

Joel talks on a phone.  The wind howls around him.  He tries
to shield the mouthpiece as he talks.

		JOEL
	Hi, Cindy.  Joel.  Listen, I'm not
	feeling well this morning.  No.  Food
	poisoning, I think.  Sorry it took me so
	long to call in, but I've been vomiting.","In this scene, Joel is standing outside the train station, bracing himself against the wind as he makes a phone call. He tells the person on the other end, Cindy, that he is feeling ill and won't be able to make it to work. He explains that he believes he has food poisoning and apologizes for not calling in earlier, but he had been busy vomiting."
"EXT. BEACH - DAY

Joel wanders the windy, empty beach, with his briefcase.  He
passes an old man with a metal detector.  They nod at each
other.

Later: Joel looks out at the ocean.

Later: Joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook.  He
opens it and writes with a gloved hand.

		JOEL
	January 13th, 2006.  Today I skipped work
	and took the train out to Montauk.
		(thinks)
	It's cold.
		(thinks some more)
	The sky is gray.
		(thinks some more)
	I don't know what else to say.  Nothing
	happens.  Nothing changes.  I saw Naomi
	last night.  We had sex.  It was weird to
	fall into our old familiar sex life so
	easily.  Like no time has passed.  After
	two years apart suddenly we're talking
	about getting together again.  I guess
	that's good.

He has no other thoughts.  He glances up, spots a female
figure in the distance, walking in his direction.  She stands
out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded
sweatshirt.  It's Clementine.  He watches her for a bit, then
as she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least
pretends to.  Once she passed, he watches her walk away.  She
stops and stares out at the ocean.  Joel writes.

		JOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
	If I'm constitutionally incapable of
	making eye-contact with a woman I don't
	know.  I guess I'd better get back to
	Naomi.

Later: Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the
season.  He peeks cautiously in a dark window.

Later: Joel digs into the sand with a stick.","Joel is seen walking along a deserted beach with his briefcase. He comes across an old man searching for something with a metal detector and they nod at each other. Later, Joel sits on a rock and writes in his notebook about his day, his thoughts and seeing his ex-girlfriend, Naomi, the previous night. While writing, Joel sees Clementine walking towards him, but he avoids eye contact and continues to write. Joel continues his walk along the beach and peeks into a closed beach house before digging into the sand with a stick."
"INT. DINER - DAY

It's a local tourist place, but off-season empty.  Joel sits
in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of
tomato soup.  An elderly couple drink coffee at the counter.
Clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood.  Joel
glances at her bright blue hair.  She picks an empty booth
and sits.  Joel studies her discreetly.  The waitress
approaches her with a coffee pot.

		WAITRESS
	Coffee?

		CLEMENTINE
	God, yes.  You've saved my life!

The waitress pours the coffee.

		WAITRESS
	You know what you want yet?

		CLEMENTINE
		(laughing)
	Ain't that the question of the century.

The waitress is not amused.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You got grilled cheese and tomato soup?

		WAITRESS
	Yeah.  We're having a run on it.

The waitress heads to the grill.  Clementine fishes in her
bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment,
pours something in, then brings the cup back up.

		CLEMENTINE
		(calling)
	And some cream, please.

Clementine looks around the place.  Her eyes meet Joel's
before he is able to look away.  She smiles vaguely.  He
looks embarrassed, then down at his journal.  Clementine
pulls a book from her purse and starts to read.  Joel glances
up, tries to see the cover.  It's blue.  He can't read the
title.","In this scene, Joel is eating at a diner when Clementine enters with bright blue hair. She orders coffee and grilled cheese and tomato soup while making small talk with the waitress. Clementine pours something into her coffee cup from her bag. She catches Joel's eye and looks at him before he looks away. She starts to read a blue book, but Joel can't see the title."
"EXT. BEACH - DAY

Joel stares out at the ocean.  Far down the beach Clementine
stares at it, too.  Joel glances sideways at her then back at
the ocean.","In this scene from the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Joel and Clementine are both standing on a beach, with Joel staring out at the ocean. Clementine is also staring out at the ocean but is further down the beach than Joel. Joel glances over at her briefly before returning his gaze back to the ocean."
"EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON

Joel sits on the bench waiting for a train.  Clementine
enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there.
She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if
they're old friends.  He waves back, embarrassed.  She takes
a seat on a bench far down the platform.  Joel stares at his
hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to
conceal his awkwardness.","In this scene, we see Joel waiting for a train at the Montauk train station. He's by himself until Clementine enters the platform. She sees him and waves enthusiastically, acting as if they're old friends. Joel feels embarrassed and waves back, but chooses to sit far away from her. He tries to hide his awkwardness by writing in his journal."
"INT. TRAIN - A BIT LATER

Joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the
slowly passing desolate terrain.  After a moment the door
between cars opens and Clementine enters.  Joel looks up.
Clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding
where to sit.  She settles on a seat at the opposite end of
the car.  Joel looks out the window.  He feels her watching
him.  The train is picking up speed.  Finally:

		CLEMENTINE
		(calling over the rumble)
	Hi!

Joel looks over.

		JOEL
	I'm sorry.

		CLEMENTINE
	Why?

		JOEL
	Why what?

		CLEMENTINE
	Why are you sorry?  I just said hi.

		JOEL
	No, I didn't know if you were talking to
	me, so...

She looks around the empty car.

		CLEMENTINE
	Really?

		JOEL
		(embarrassed)
	Well, I didn't want to assume.

		CLEMENTINE
	Aw, c'mon, live dangerously.  Take the
	leap and assume someone is talking to you
	in an otherwise empty car.

		JOEL
	Anyway.  Sorry.  Hi.

Clementine makes her way down the aisle towards Joel.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's okay if I sit closer?  So I don't
	have to scream.  Not that I don't need to
	scream sometimes, believe me.
		(pause)
	But I don't want to bug you if you're
	trying to write or something.

		JOEL
	No, I mean, I don't know.  I can't really
	think of much to say probably.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh.  So...

She hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she
came from.

		JOEL
	I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down
	here.  I didn't mean to --

		CLEMENTINE
	No, I don't want to bug you if you're
	trying to --

		JOEL
	It's okay, really.

		CLEMENTINE
	Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe.
	I have a long trip ahead of me.
		(sits across aisle from Joel)
	How far are you going?  On the train, I
	mean, of course.

		JOEL
	Rockville Center.

		CLEMENTINE
	Get out!  Me too!  What are the odds?

		JOEL
	The weirder part is I think actually I
	recognize you.  I thought that earlier in
	the diner.  That's why I was looking at
	you.  You work at Borders, right?

		CLEMENTINE
	Ucch, really?  You're kidding.  God.
	Bizarre small world, huh?  Yeah, that's
	me: book slave there for, like, five
	years now.

		JOEL
	Really?  Because --

		CLEMENTINE
	Jesus, is it five years?  I gotta quit
	right now.

		JOEL
	-- because I go there all the time.  I
	don't think I ever saw you before.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, I'm there.  I hide in the back as
	much as is humanly possible.  You have a
	cell phone?  I need to quit right this
	minute.  I'll call in dead.

		JOEL
	I don't have one.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'll go on the dole.  Like my daddy
	before me.

		JOEL
	I noticed your hair.  I guess it made an
	impression on me, that's why I was pretty
	sure I recognized you.

		CLEMENTINE
	Ah, the hair.
		(pulls a strand in front of her
		 eyes, studies it)
	Blue, right?  It's called Blue Ruin.  The
	color.  Snappy name, huh?

		JOEL
	I like it.

		CLEMENTINE
	Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were
	wondering.

		JOEL
	Yeah.  Tom Waits says it in --

		CLEMENTINE
	Exactly!  Tom Waits.  Which song?

		JOEL
	I can't remember.

		CLEMENTINE
	Anyway, this company makes a whole line
	of colors with equally snappy names.  Red
	Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.
	That'd be a job, coming up with those
	names.  How do you get a job like that?
	That's what I'll do.  Fuck the dole.

		JOEL
	I don't really know how --

		CLEMENTINE
	Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.

		JOEL
	You think that could possibly be a full
	time job?  How many hair colors could
	there be?

		CLEMENTINE
		(pissy)
	Someone's got that job.
		(excited)
	Agent Orange!  I came up with that one.
	Anyway, there are endless color
	possibilities and I'd be great at it.

		JOEL
	I'm sure you would.

		CLEMENTINE
	My writing career!  Your hair written by
	Clementine Kruczynski.
		(thought)
	The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.

		JOEL
	You sure?  That doesn't sound --

		CLEMENTINE
	I think.  Anyway, I've tried all their
	colors.  More than once.  I'm getting too
	old for this.  But it keeps me from
	having to develop an actual personality.
	I apply my personality in a paste.  You?

		JOEL
	Oh, I doubt that's the case.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, you don't know me, so... you don't
	know, do you?

		JOEL
	Sorry.  I was just trying to be nice.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, I got it.

There's a silence.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	My name's Clementine, by the way.

		JOEL
	I'm Joel.

		CLEMENTINE
	No jokes about my name?  Oh, you wouldn't
	do that; you're trying to be nice.

		JOEL
	I don't know any jokes about your name.

		CLEMENTINE
	Huckleberry Hound?

		JOEL
	I don't know what that means.

		CLEMENTINE
	Huckleberry Hound!  What, are you nuts?

		JOEL
	I'm nut nuts.

		CLEMENTINE
		(singing)
	Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my
	darlin' Clementine?  No?

		JOEL
	Sorry.  It's a pretty name, though.  It
	means ""merciful"", right?

		CLEMENTINE
		(impressed)
	Yeah.  Although it hardly fits.  I'm a
	vindictive little bitch, truth be told.

		JOEL
	See, I wouldn't think that about you.

		CLEMENTINE
		(pissy)
	Why wouldn't you think that about me?

		JOEL
	Oh.  I don't know.  I was just... I don't
	know.  I was... You seemed nice, so --

		CLEMENTINE
	Now I'm nice?  Don't you know any other
	adjectives?  There's careless and snotty
	and overbearing and argumentative...
	mumpish.

		JOEL
	Well, anyway... Sorry.

They sit in silence for a while.

		CLEMENTINE
	I just don't think ""nice"" is a
	particularly interesting thing to be.

The conductor enters the car.

		CONDUCTOR
	Tickets.

Joel hands the conductor his ticket.  The conductor punches
it and hands it back.

		CLEMENTINE
	What is nice, anyway?  I mean, besides an
	adjective?  I guess it can be an adverb,
	sort of.

The conductor turns to Clementine.  She fishes in her bag.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	It doesn't reveal anything.  Nice is
	pandering.  Cowardly.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	And life is more interesting than that.
	Or should be.  Jesus God, I hope it is...
	someday.
		(to conductor)
	I know it's here.

The conductor and Joel watch as she gets more agitated.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I don't need nice.  I don't need myself
	to be it and I don't need anyone else to
	be it at me.

		JOEL
	Okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Shit.  Shit.  I know it's here.  Hold on.

She dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts
frantically through.  Joel sees the book she was reading in
the diner.  It's The Play by Stephen Dixon.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Damn it.  DAMN IT!
		(there it is)
	Oh.  Here.

She hands the conductor the tickets, smiles sweetly.  He
punches it, hands it back to her, and walks away.

		CONDUCTOR
	Next stop Southampton.

The conductor heads into the next car.  Clementine shoves
stuff back into her purse.  Her hands are a little shaky.
She pulls a airline-sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket,
opens it, and downs it.  Joel is watching all of this but
pretending not to.  She looks out the window for a while.
The train pulls into the station.  The doors open.  Nobody
gets on.  The doors close.  The train pulls out.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel?  It's Joel, right?

		JOEL
	Yes?

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm sorry I... yelled at you.  Was it
	yelling?  I can't really tell.  Whatever,
	I'm a little out of sorts today.

		JOEL
	That's okay.

		CLEMENTINE
		(stares out window)
	My embarrassing admission is I really
	like that you're nice.  Right now,
	anyway.  I can't tell from one moment to
	the next what I'm going to like.  But
	right now I'm glad you said, ""that's
	okay"" to me.  That was nice of you.

		JOEL
	It's no problem.  Anyway, I have some
	stuff I need to --

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh, okay.  Well, sure, I'll just...
		(stands, throws bag over
		 shoulder)
	Take care, then.

		JOEL
		(pulling journal from
		 briefcase)
	Probably see you at the book store.

		CLEMENTINE
		(heading toward other end of
		 car)
	Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.

Clementine sits and stares out the window.","Joel is riding on an empty train and watching the desert landscape pass by. Clementine enters the train and sits away from Joel. After Joel embarrassedly greets her, they strike up a conversation about her job, hair, and other seemingly meaningless topics. When the conductor arrives, Clementine can't find her ticket and gets increasingly agitated before finally finding it. She downs alcohol from a miniature bottle and later tells Joel that she likes that he's nice. As they reach their destination, they say goodbye and possibly plan to meet at a bookstore."
"INT. TRAIN - LATER

There are a few more people in the car now.  Clementine has
inched a few seats closer to Joel.  She watches him.  His
head is immersed in his journal.","In this scene, Clementine and Joel are on a train with other passengers. Over time, Clementine moves a few seats closer to Joel. She observes him as he writes in his journal, seemingly fully invested in it."
"INT. TRAIN - LATER

It's dark out.  The train is pretty crowded.  Joel stares out
the window.  Clementine sits closer still to Joel, eyes him.","In this scene, Joel and Clementine are on a train, it's dark outside and the train is crowded. Joel is staring out the window lost in thought. Clementine, on the other hand, is sitting close to him and staring at him."
"EXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING

The doors open and Joel emerges along with others.  He heads
to the parking lot, arrives at the car.  There's a big dented
scrape along the driver's side.  He gets in.","In this scene, Joel exits a train station and heads towards his car in a parking lot. His car has a big dent and scrape on the driver's side, but he still enters the car."
"INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Joel drives.  He passes Clementine walking.  She looks cold.
He considers, slows, rolls down his window.

		JOEL
	Hi.  I could give you a ride if you need.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, that's okay.  Thanks, though.

		JOEL
	You're sure?  It's cold.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't want to take you out of your way.

		JOEL
	It's okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah?

He pulls over.  She climbs in.  They drive.

		JOEL
	Where do you live?

		CLEMENTINE
	You're not a stalker or anything, right?

		JOEL
	Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were,
	but no.

		CLEMENTINE
	You can't be too careful.  I've been
	stalked.  I've been told I'm highly
	stalkable.  I don't need that.

		JOEL
	I'm not a stalker.

		CLEMENTINE
		(beat)
	You know Wilmont?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	Wilmont.  Near the high school.

Joel turns.  They drive in silence.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of
	nutso.  I'm not really.

		JOEL
	It's okay.  I didn't think you were.

There's a silence.

		CLEMENTINE
	So you like bookstores, huh?

		JOEL
	I like to read.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me too.  It is Rain Dogs, by the way.

		JOEL
	Yeah?  I can't remember that album very
	well.  I remember liking it.  But --

		CLEMENTINE
	The song's 9th and Hennepin.  I spent
	most of the train ride trying to
	remember.  ""Till you're full of rag water
	and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill
	out/Over the side to anyone who'll
	listen.""  Remember?

		JOEL
	Sort of, um...

		CLEMENTINE
	Remember?  ""And you take on the dreams of
	the ones who have slept there/And I'm
	lost in the window/I hide on the
	stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in
	your hat...""
		(starts to cry)
	Oh, shit.  I'm so stupid.  Sorry.

		JOEL
	What?

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm just a bit of a wreck.  ""I sleep in
	your hat"" makes me cry.
		(pointing to a house)
	Me.

Joel pulls over.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Thanks very much.  That was very nice of
	you.

		JOEL
	Well, I wouldn't want to be --

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh, geez, I'm full of shit.  I already
	told you that.
		(pause)
	Anyway.  See Ya.

Clementine opens the car door.

		JOEL
	Take care.

		CLEMENTINE
		(turning back)
	Hey, do you want to have a drink?  I have
	lots of drinks.  And I could --

		JOEL
	Um --

		CLEMENTINE
	Never mind.  Sorry, that was stupid.  I'm
	embarrassed.  Good night, Joel.","Joel is driving and sees Clementine walking. He offers her a ride and she reluctantly accepts. They have a slightly awkward conversation about where she lives and their shared love of books and music. Clementine becomes emotional when discussing a song that makes her cry. Joel drops her off at her house, but she invites him in for a drink before quickly retracting the offer and apologizing. She says good night and leaves."
"INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Joel stands in the living room, somewhat nervously.  He tries
to calm himself by focusing on the surroundings.  He looks at
the books on her shelves.  Clementine is in the kitchen.  We
see her as she passes by the doorway several times, preparing
drinks and chatting.

		CLEMENTINE
	Thanks.  I like it, too.  Been here about
	four years.  It's really cheap.  My
	downstairs neighbor is old so she's
	quiet, which is great.  And the
	landlord's sweet, which is bizarre, but
	great, and I have a little porch in the
	back, which is great, because I can read
	there, and listen to my crickets and...

Clementine is in the living room now with two gin and tonics.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Two blue ruins...

Joel is looking at a framed black and white photograph of
crows flying.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You like that?

		JOEL
	Very much.

		CLEMENTINE
	This... someone gave that to me, just
	like, recently.  I like it, too.  I like
	crows.  I think I used to be a crow.

She caws and hands Joel a drink.

		JOEL
	Thanks.  That was good, that crow sound.

		CLEMENTINE
	Do you believe in that stuff?
	Reincarnation?

		JOEL
	I don't know.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me neither.  Oh, there's an inscription
	on the back.
		(takes it off the wall, reads:)
	The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust
	of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my
	heart/A change of mood/And saved some
	part/Of a day I rued.

		JOEL
	Frost?

		CLEMENTINE
		(impressed)
	Yeah.  I'm not, like, a Robert Frost
	lover by any stretch.  His stuff seems
	strictly grade school to me.  But this
	made me cry for some reason.  Maybe
	because it is grade school.  Y'know?

		JOEL
	It's pretty.

		CLEMENTINE
	I miss grade school.  I don't know why
	I'm calling it grade school all of a
	sudden.  When I went we called it
	elementary school.  But I like grade
	school better.  Sounds like something
	someone from the forties would call it.
	I'd like to be from then.  Everyone wore
	hats.  Anyway, cheers!

		JOEL
	Cheers.

They click glasses.  Clementine giggles and takes a big gulp
of her drink.  Joel sips.  She plops down on the couch and
pulls her boots off.

		CLEMENTINE
	God, that feels so fucking good.  Take
	yours off.

		JOEL
	I'm fine.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah?  Well, have a seat, anyway.

Joel sits in a chair across the room.  Clementine finishes
her drink.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Ready for another?

		JOEL
	No, I'm okay for now.

She heads toward the kitchen with her glass.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, I'm ready.  Put some music on.

Joel crosses to the CD's and studies them.

		JOEL
	What do you want to hear?

		CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
	You pick it.

		JOEL
	You just say.  I'm not really --

		CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
	I don't know!  I can't see them from
	here, Joel!  Just pick something good.

Joel studies the unfamiliar CD's.  He picks up Bang On a Can
performing Brian Eno's Music for Airports to look at.
Clementine reenters with her drink.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Oh, excellent choice.

She grabs it and sticks it in the CD player.  The music is
dreamy and haunting and slow.  Clementine falls back onto the
couch, closes her eyes and sips her drink.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Mmmmmmm.  Way to go, Joel.  You pick
	good.

Joel sits down in his chair and drinks.  There's a silence,
which seems fine to Clementine but makes Joel anxious.

		JOEL
	Well, I should probably get going.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, stay.  Just for a little while.
		(opens her eyes, brightly)
	Refill?

		JOEL
	No.  I --

		CLEMENTINE
	I know a man who needs a refill.

She grabs Joel's drink from his hand, takes it into the
kitchen.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)
	God bless alcohol, is what I say.  Where
	would I be without it.  Oh, Jesus, Mary,
	and Joseph, maybe I don't want to think
	about that.

She giggles.  Joel looks around the room again.  There are
several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade
costumes: a nurse potato, a stripper potato, a schoolteacher
potato, a housewife potato.  Clementine returns with Joel's
drink and a refill for herself.

		JOEL
	Thanks.

		CLEMENTINE
	Drink up, young man.  It'll make the
	whole seduction part less repugnant.

Joel looks a little alarmed.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I'm just kidding.  C'mon.

She sits back on the couch, closes her eyes.  Joel watches
her, looks at her breasts.  She opens her eyes, smiles
drunkenly at him.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.

		JOEL
	Yeah?

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, I go to a psychic and she's always
	telling me I'm psychic.  She should know.
	Do you believe in that stuff?

		JOEL
	I don't know.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me neither.  But sometimes I have
	premonitions, so, I don't know.  Maybe
	that's just coincidence.  Right?  Y'know,
	you think something and then it happens,
	or you think a word and then someone says
	it?  Y'know?

		JOEL
	Yeah, I don't know.  It's hard to know.

		CLEMENTINE
	Exactly.  Exactly!  That's exactly my
	feeling about it.  It's hard to know.
	Like, okay, but how many times do I think
	something and it doesn't happen?  That's
	what you're saying, right?  You forget
	about those times.  Right?

		JOEL
	Yeah, I guess.

		CLEMENTINE
		(dreamy beat)
	But I think I am.  I like to think I am.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	It's helpful to think there's some order
	to things.  You're kind of closed
	mouthed, aren't you?

		JOEL
	Sorry.  My life isn't that interesting.
	I go to work.  I go home.  I don't know
	what to say.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh.
		(considers this)
	Does that make you sad?  Or anxious?  I'm
	always anxious thinking I'm not living my
	life to the fullest, y'know?  Taking
	advantage of every possibility?  Just
	making sure that I'm not wasting one
	second of the little time I have.

		JOEL
	I think about that.

She looks at him really hard for a long moment.  Joel tries
to hold her gaze, but can't.  He looks down at his drink.
Clementine starts to cry again.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're really nice.  I'm sorry I yelled
	at you before about it.  God, I'm an
	idiot.

		JOEL
	I do have a tendency to use that word too
	much.

		CLEMENTINE
	I like you.  That's the thing about my
	psychic thing.  I think that's my
	greatest psychic power, that I get a
	sense about people.  My problem is I
	never trust it.  But I get it.  And with
	you I get that you're a really good guy.

		JOEL
	Thanks.

		CLEMENTINE
	And, anyway, you sell yourself short.  I
	can tell.  There's a lot of stuff going
	on in your brain.  I can tell.  My
	goal... can I tell you my goal?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
		(ala Paul Simon)
	What's the goal, Joel?
		(laughs)
	My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow
	through me?  Do you know what I mean?
	It's like, there's all these emotions and
	ideas and they come quick and they change
	and they leave and they come back in a
	different form and I think we're all
	taught we should be consistent.  Y'know?
	You love someone -- that's it.  Forever.
	You choose to do something with your life
	-- that's it, that's what you do.  It's a
	sign of maturity to stick with that and
	see things through.  And my feeling is
	that's how you die, because you stop
	listening to what is true, and what is
	true is constantly changing.  You know?

		JOEL
	Yeah.  I think so.  It's hard to --

		CLEMENTINE
	Like I wanted to talk to you.  I didn't
	need any more reason to do it.  Who knows
	what bigger cosmic reason might exist?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're very nice.  God, I have to stop
	saying that.  You're nervous around me,
	huh?

		JOEL
	No.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm nervous.  You don't need to be
	nervous around me, though.  I like you.
	Do you think I'm repulsively fat?

		JOEL
	No, not at all.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't either.  I used to.  But I'm
	through with that.  Y'know, if I don't
	love my body, then I'm just lost.  You
	know?

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	With all the wrinkles and scars and the
	general falling apart that's coming
	'round the bend.
		(beat)
	So, I've been seeing this guy...

Joel looks slightly crestfallen.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
		(off his reaction)
	Well, for the last week, anyway!  He's
	kind of a kid.  Kind of a goofball, but
	he's really stuck on me, which is
	flattering.  Who wouldn't like that?  And
	he's, like, a dope, but he says these
	smart and moving things sometimes, out of
	nowhere, that just break my heart.  He's
	the one who gave me that crow photograph.

		JOEL
	Oh, yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	That made me cry.  But, anyway, we went
	up to Boston, because I had this urge to
	lie on my back on the Charles River.  It
	gets frozen this time of year.

		JOEL
	That's scary sounding.

		CLEMENTINE
	Exactly!  I used to do it in college and
	I had this urge to go do it again, so I
	got Patrick and we drove all night to get
	there and he was sweet and said nice
	things to me, but I was really
	disappointment to be there with him.
	Y'know?  And that's where psychic stuff
	comes in.  Like, it just isn't right with
	him.  Y'know?

		JOEL
	I think so.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't believe in that soulmate crap
	anymore, but... he says so many great
	things.  We like the same writers.  This
	writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to.
	And he's cute.  It's fucked up.  Joel,
	you should come up to the Charles with me
	sometime.

		JOEL
	Okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah?  Oh, great!

She sits closer to him.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic --
	night picnics are different -- and --

		JOEL
		(shy)
	Sounds good.  But right now I should go.

		CLEMENTINE
		(pause)
	You should stay.

		JOEL
	I have to get up early in the morning
	tomorrow, so...

		CLEMENTINE
		(beat)
	Okay.

Joel puts on his overcoat.  Clementine heads to the phone
table, pulls out a notepad.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I would like you to call me.  Would you
	do that?  I would like that.

		JOEL
	Yes.

She scribbles her phone number, hands it to him.  He puts it
in his pocket.  He stands there uncomfortably for a moment,
then forces himself to speak.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I don't think your personality comes out
	of a tube.  I think the hair is just... a
	pretty topping.

She tears up, swallows, and kisses him on the cheek.  He's
surprised and pleased and nervous.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
		(shyly formal)
	So, I enjoyed meeting you.

		CLEMENTINE
	You'll call me, right?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	When?

		JOEL
	Tomorrow?

		CLEMENTINE
	Tonight.  Just to test out the phone
	lines and all.

		JOEL
	Okay.

We stay with Clementine as she watches Joel tromping through
the snow and getting in his car.","Joel visits Clementine at her apartment where they share drinks and conversation. Clementine shows Joel a framed photograph of crows and they discuss the inscriptions behind it. They talk about psychic abilities and the flow of emotions and ideas. Clementine tells Joel about a guy she has been seeing but is not sure about. She suggests that they should go up to the Charles River sometime. As Joel prepares to leave, Clementine asks him to call her and he agrees."
"INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel speeds through the suburban Rockville Center
neighborhood.  There is no snow on the ground.  He seems
different, somehow foggy and disoriented.

SUBTITLE:  THREE DAYS EARLIER

He arrives at his apartment building and parks.","In this scene from ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" Joel drives through a suburban neighborhood that is not covered in snow and appears to be disoriented in some way. The scene then flashes back three days earlier and shows Joel parking his car at his apartment building."
"EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Joel gets out of his car, spots a van parked across the
street.  There are two dark figures inside.

		VOICE-OVER
	Them.

He hurries inside the building.","In this scene, Joel arrives at his apartment building and notices a van parked across the street. Inside the van, there are two people Joel recognizes. In fear, he quickly enters the building."
"INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel enters, dumps his overcoat on a chair, turns off the
lights, crosses to look furtively out the window.  It's
snowing in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam
of a streetlight.

		JOEL
	It was snowing.

		VOICE-OVER
	There are two of them.  Couldn't make
	them out.  The orange glow of a
	cigarette.

Joel squints to see inside the van.  Two dark figures talk.
One sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily
illuminates the interior.  The figure in the driver seat
rolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to Joel.

		JOEL
	The driver waved.  So casual, friendly.

		VOICE-OVER
	I'm like a joke to them.

Joel pulls away from the window, his face blanched.

		VOICE-OVER
	I guess they figure they can act like
	they want.  They don't have to worry
	about me remembering.

He paces, mulling things over.  As he does, the scene starts
to change, almost as if it is drying out.

		JOEL
	I might be making a mistake.

		VOICE-OVER
	Maybe I'm making a mistake.  Maybe I just
	need to learn to live with this.  First
	of all, I'll get over it.  Secondly, it
	happened.  Those who do not remember
	history are condemned to repeat it.  Who
	said that?  Churchill?  I'm not sure.
	But I don't care.  She did it to me.  I
	have to rid myself of this.  Fuck her.

		JOEL
	Fuck you, Clementine.

The colors bleach, the surroundings become slightly vague.
Even Joel's persona and voice-over seem to alter, his
emotional intensity becoming diffused.  Joel does not seem
aware of this.  He stops pacing, takes a small vial from his
pocket, dumps the lone pill onto his palm.  He looks at it.
It's pink.  There's some illegible initials stamped on it.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Pink.
		(beat)
	There was a number on it.  I remember.
	AL 1718?
		(beat)
	I have to follow through with this.  I
	have no choice.

		VOICE-OVER
	The pill was pink, I remember.  It had
	some letters and numbers on it.  What
	were they?  AL 1718?  AL something.  Four
	digits.  I don't like taking pills when I
	don't know what they are.  I have no
	choice.

He swallows it, peeks out the window again, takes off his
clothes, slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store
packaging.  He sits on the edge of the bed, dials the phone.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	We're sorry, the number you have
	dialed...
		(beat)
	Screw you, Clementine, for doing this ...

		RECORDED VOICE
	We're sorry, the number you have dialed
	is no longer in service.  If you think
	you have reached this recording in error
	-

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Bye.

Joel hangs up and lies on his back on the bed.  By now the
scene is lifeless, almost a husk.  He hears the apartment
building door open.  He hears footsteps.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	It's them.

		VOICE-OVER
	It's too late.

His eyelids are getting heavy.  He closes his eyes.

BLACK.

He hears a key in his apartment door.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Fuck.","Joel is in his apartment, and he looks out the window to see two dark figures talking in a van. One of the figures waves at him, but Joel feels like a joke to them. Joel paces, and the scene starts to change. He takes a pill from his pocket, swallows it, and calls Clementine only to hear that the number is no longer in service. He lies on his bed as the apartment building door opens and hears footsteps before the scene goes black."
"INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Joel sits in the bookstore coffee shop.  It's a jarring
transition, visually and emotionally.  Joel is in the midst
of some traumatic state of mind.
He fingers the vial with the pink pill in it as he watches
Clementine stack books on shelves.  Her hair is bright orange
now.

		JOEL
	I should maybe talk to you.

		VOICE-OVER
	Clementine.  I should just maybe talk to
	her.

Joel rises and heads toward Clementine.

		JOEL
	I love you and if you knew that... if I
	told you what happened...  I'll explain
	everything, what we meant to each other.
	I'll tell you everything about our time
	together.  You'll know everything again
	and...

		VOICE-OVER
	Maybe if I just explain what happened, I
	wouldn't have to go through this and I
	could tell you everything and it would be
	like you knew and we could rebuild and we
	could be happy again and...

Right before Joel gets there, Patrick, a skinny young man
approaches Clementine.  Joel stops, watches.  The young man
seems out of breath.  He glances over at Joel, then taps
Clementine on the shoulder.  She turns, annoyed, sees who it
is and her face lights up.

		JOEL
	Clementine.

		VOICE-OVER
	That's your look for me.

Clementine giggles, stands and pokes Patrick playfully in the
ribs.

		PATRICK
	I just thought I'd say hi.  I was in the
	neighborhood.

		CLEMENTINE
	You were not.

		PATRICK
	I was not.

Joel is mesmerized by their familiarity.  As he stands there,
the scene starts to dry out.
Clementine and Patrick continue their flirtation but it's
turning lifeless, as if they are just reciting lines.  The
bookstore start to lose its color and immediacy.

		CLEMENTINE
	Come over after I'm done here?

		PATRICK
	I can't.  I want to, but I have to study.

		CLEMENTINE
	You rat.

		PATRICK
	I really want to, but tonight's
	important.  Test tomorrow.

		JOEL
	How could she have done this to me?  How
	could anyone do this to anyone?

		CLEMENTINE
		(to Patrick)
	You didn't say anything about my hair.

		PATRICK
	It's so cool.  You're by far the most
	sensational person in the room.

		CLEMENTINE
	In the room?

		PATRICK
	In the world.

Joel seems dazed, in some sort of dream confusion, as he
realizes the world around him is looking increasingly odd.

		JOEL
	What's happening here?
		(looks at watch; it's 9:30)
	Oh, God!  I have to go home.  They'll be
	there soon.

Joel turns to leave.","Joel is in a bookstore cafe, visibly disturbed and holding a vial with a pink pill in it. Clementine, with a bright orange hair, stacks books on shelves. Joel stands up and heads towards Clementine to confess his love for her. However, before he can reach her, Patrick, a young skinny man, comes and interrupts them. They talk and flirt, and Joel feels strange as if the scene is getting dialed down. Clementine invites Patrick to her place, but Patrick declines as he has an important test the next day. Joel looks at his watch and leaves, feeling increasingly confused about what is happening around him."
"INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel drives fast, recklessly.  The intensity is back.  He's
weeping as he drives.

		JOEL
	Gotta get home.  How could she do this to
	me?
	How could she not care about what we
	meant to each other.  What a fuck!  What
	a fucking monster she is!

		VOICE-OVER
	Oh, God.  I miss her.  I can't believe
	she's with that guy now!  I'm never going
	to see her again.  I love her so much.
	What a fucking monster she is!

The scene is faded as he parks in front of his apartment
building, and gets out of the car.  Joel spots the parked

coat.

	Ah, Mr. Barish.  This is Stan.  He'll be
	in charge of your procedure tonight.

Stan nods professionally.

		STAN
	Mr. Barish.

		JOEL
	How exactly is this going to work
	tonight?

As Mierzwiak talks, the room colors start to fade,
Mierzwiak's tone of voice is also affected; it becomes dry
and monotonous.

		MIERZWIAK
	We'll start with your most recent
	memories and go backwards -- There is an
	emotional core to each of our memories --
	As we eradicate this core, it starts its
	degradation process --  By the time you
	wake up in the morning, all memories
	we've targeted will have withered and
	disappeared.  Like a dream upon waking.

		JOEL
	Is there any sort of risk of brain
	damage?

		MIERZWIAK
	Well, technically, the procedure itself
	is brain damage, but on a par with a
	night of heavy drinking.  Nothing you'll
	miss.

Joel looks quizzically at the eroding environment.  Suddenly
he gets it.

		JOEL
	It's happening now!  I'm already in my
	brain.

Mierzwiak looks at the fading room.

		MIERZWIAK
	Yes, I suppose you are.
		(back in his faded memory
		 persona)
	So, let's get started -- If we want the
	procedure underway tonight, we have some
	work to do.

Joel is sitting in a chair.  Electrodes connect him to some
electronic machinery monitored by Stan.  Mierzwiak watches
from the corner.

		STAN
	We use the articles you brought to create
	a map of Clementine in your brain.
	Tonight while you sleep we'll be able to
	trace the map and erase.

		JOEL
	But you're tracing and erasing now.  It's
	already started.  I'm home in my bed.

Stan pulls a snow globe from one of Joel's bags, shows it to
Joel.  The equipment registers Joel's reaction.

		STAN
	Very good.

Stan pulls out a potato dressed as a Vegas showgirl.  Joel
studies it.  The machines register his response.

		MIERZWIAK
	We'll dispose of these mementos when
	we're done here.  That way you won't be
	confused later by their unexplainable
	presence in your home.

Stan pulls out a coffee mug with a photo of Clementine
printed on it.  Joel looks at the cup.  The machines record
his reaction.

		STAN
	Good.  We're getting healthy read-outs.

The room, Stan, and Mierzwiak are now vague and wispy.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Patrick, do me a favor --

Joel is watching Stan.  Stan is not speaking, yet his voice
continues.

	-- and check the voltage levels, I'm not
	wiping as clean as I would like here.

Joel looks up.  Stan's voice seems to be coming from above.","Joel enters a laboratory where he meets with Mierzwiak and Stan.

As they speak, the colors in the room start to fade, and the tone of their voices changes. Joel realizes that it has already started and expresses his confusion. Stan shows Joel various objects, including a snow globe, and a coffee mug with Clementine's photo on it, while monitoring his reaction.

"INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel lies on his back in fresh pajamas.  His eyes are closed
and electrodes connect his head to several machines.  The
machines are operated by Stan, now in grubby street clothes
and in need of a shave, and by Patrick, dressed similarly.
The monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light
blips running like streams through an image of Joel's brain.
Stan presses buttons and operates a joystick, aiming for the
lines.  Patrick (who we saw earlier with Clementine at the
bookstore) studies a meter on one of the machines.

	The voltage looks fine.

Patrick fiddles with some jacks.

	invaluable.

	tonight.  Oh, Christ:  I don't know what
	to do.  Her name is Clementine and she's

	passionate and sensitive.  Things with
	Naomi and I have been stagnant for so
	long.

	I think we got this one.  Let's push on.

Joel looks up at the ceiling.","In a lab room, Stan shows Mierzwiak his journal, which he thinks will be useful to them.

"INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Joel, snapped into a new memory, cries as he fills two large
plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with
Clementine.  There are funny little gifts, wind-up toys, some
potatoes dressed as women, some clothing Clementine has left
there, some CD's.  He pulls a big clump of pages out of his
loose-leaf journal and dumps them in the bag.

home.  Naomi worked on her dissertation.

	No one.","In this scene from ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" Carrie and Joel are sitting in their faded kitchen, drinking coffee. Carrie asks Joel about the girl he walked off with, to which Joel responds that there was no one."
"EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - NIGHT

small cluster of cars in an otherwise empty parking lot.","Three characters, Rob, Carrie, and Joel, exit their car in a small beach parking lot at night. The parking lot is mostly empty except for a few other cars."

down the beach.  People and music can be heard.","In this scene, Joel, Rob and Carrie walk out of the brush and discover that there is a bonfire down the beach with music playing and people are having fun."
"EXT. BEACH - LATER

Joel sits on a log, a paper plate of chicken and corn on his
lap.  People warm themselves at the fire.  Joel watches
couples talking, kissing, Rob sharing a joint with a guy.

		JOEL
	You were down by the surf.  I could just
	make you out in the dark.

Joel looks down to the water.  There's Clementine, in her
orange hooded sweatshirt, looking out to sea.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Your back to me.  In that orange
	sweatshirt I would come to know so well
	and even hate eventually.  At the time I
	thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.

		VOICE-OVER
	I remember being drawn to you even then.
	I thought, I love this woman because
	she's alone down there looking out at the
	black ocean.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	But I went back to my food.  The next
	thing I remember, I felt someone sitting
	next to me and I saw the orange sleeve
	out of the corner of my eye.

A shot of the orange sleeve.  Joel looks up.

		CLEMENTINE
	Hi there.

		JOEL
	Hi.

		VOICE-OVER
	I was so nervous.  What were you doing
	there, I wondered.  Your hair was lime
	green.  Green revolution.

A shot of her green hair.

		JOEL
	You said...

		CLEMENTINE
	I saw you sitting over here.  By
	yourself.  I thought, thank God, someone
	normal, who doesn't know how interact at
	these things either.

		JOEL
	Yeah.  I don't ever know what to say.

		CLEMENTINE
	I can't tell you how happy I am to hear
	that.  I mean, I don't mean I'm happy
	you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm
	such a loser.  Every time I come to a
	party I tell myself I'm going to be
	different and it's always exactly the
	same and then I hate myself after for
	being such a clod.

		JOEL
	Even then I didn't believe you entirely.
	I thought how could you be talking to me
	if you couldn't talk to people?

		VOICE-OVER
	But I thought, I don't know, I thought it
	was cool that you were sensitive enough
	to know what I was feeling and that you
	were attracted to it.

		CLEMENTINE
	But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal
	ones, y'know?  I mean, what kind of
	people do well at this stuff?

		VOICE-OVER
	And I just liked you so much.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You did?  You liked me?

		JOEL
	You know what I did.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, I know.  I'm fishing.

		JOEL
	You said --

She picks a drumstick off of Joel's plate.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm Clementine.  Can I borrow a piece of
	your chicken?

		JOEL
	And you picked it out of my plate before
	I could answer and it felt so intimate
	like we were already lovers.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I remember --

		VOICE-OVER
	The grease on your chin in the bonfire
	light.

Shot of a smudge of chicken grease on Clementine's chin.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh God, how horrid.

		JOEL
	I'm Joel.

		VOICE-OVER
	No, it was lovely.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Hi, Joel.  So no jokes about my name?

		JOEL
	You mean, like...
		(singing)
	Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my
	darlin', Clementine... ?  Huckleberry
	Hound?  That sort of thing?

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, like that.

		JOEL
	Nope.  No jokes.  My favorite thing when
	I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound
	doll.  I think your name is magic.

She smiles.

		CLEMENTINE
		(eyes welling)
	This is it, Joel.  It's gonna be gone
	soon.

		JOEL
	I know.

		CLEMENTINE
	What do we do?

		JOEL
	Enjoy it.  Say good-bye.

She nods.

Joel and Clementine are walking near the surf.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	So you're still on the Zoloft?

		VOICE-OVER
	Next thing I remember we were walking
	down near the surf.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, I stopped.  I didn't want to feel
	like I was being artificially modulated.

		JOEL
	I know what you mean.  That's why I
	stopped.

		CLEMENTINE
	But my sleeping is really fucked up.

		JOEL
	I don't think I've slept in a year.

		CLEMENTINE
	You should try Xanax.  I mean, it's a
	chemical and all, but it works... and it
	works just having it around, knowing that
	it's there.  Like insurance.

		JOEL
	yeah?

		CLEMENTINE
	I'll give you a couple.  See what you
	think.

		JOEL
	Okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?

		JOEL
	I love her.

		CLEMENTINE
	Really?  Me, too!  I don't meet people
	who even know who she is and I work in a
	book store.

		JOEL
	I think she's great.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me too.  There's this poem --

		JOEL
	Did this conversation come before or
	after we saw the house?

		CLEMENTINE
	I think, before.

		JOEL
	Seems too coincidental that way.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, maybe.

Joel and Clementine wander near some beach houses closed for
the winter.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Do you know her poem that starts ""Seaside
	gusts of wind,/And a house in which we
	don't live...

		JOEL
	Yeah, yeah.  It goes ""Perhaps there is
	someone in this world to whom I could
	send all these lines""?

		CLEMENTINE
	Yes!  I love that poem.  It breaks my
	heart.  I'm so excited you know it.
		(pointing to houses)
	Look, houses in which we don't live.

Joel chuckles appreciatively.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I wish we did.  You married?

		JOEL
	Um, no.

		CLEMENTINE
	Let's move into this neighborhood.

Clementine tries one of the doors on a darkened house.  Joel
is nervous.

		JOEL
	I do sort of live with somebody though.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh.

She walks to the next house, tries the door.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Male or female?

		JOEL
	Female.

		CLEMENTINE
	At least I haven't been barking up the
	wrong tree.

She finds a window that's unlatched.  She lifts it.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Cool.

		JOEL
	What are you doing?

		CLEMENTINE
	It's freezing out here.

She scrambles in the window.  Joel looks around, panicked.

		JOEL
		(whisper)
	Clementine.

		VOICE-OVER
	I couldn't believe you did that.  I was
	paralyzed with fear.

The front door opens and Clementine stands there beckoning.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	C'mon, man.  The water's fine.  Nobody's
	coming here tonight, believe me.  This
	place is closed up.  Electricity's off.

		JOEL
	I hesitated for what seemed like forever.

		CLEMENTINE
	I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.

He walks cautiously toward the door.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	As soon as you walked in.  I knew I had
	you.  You knew I knew that, right?","Joel and Clementine sit on the beach together eating dinner. Joel watches other couples and Rob smoke a joint as he talks to Clementine about how they first met. They talk about feeling nervous and out of place at parties, and how they were drawn to each other's sensitivity. They discuss their shared love of Anna Akhmatova and a poem she wrote about a house they stumble upon. Clementine leads Joel into one of the closed-up houses, where Joel is initially hesitant to go in but eventually follows her."
"INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Joel enters the darkened and Clementine closes the door
behind him.

		JOEL
	I knew.

		CLEMENTINE
	I knew by your nervousness that Naomi
	wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to
	criminally trespass.

		JOEL
	It's dark.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah.  What's your girlfriend's name?

		JOEL
	Naomi.

She's searching through drawers for something.  She pulls out
a flashlight, shines it in Joel's face.

		CLEMENTINE
	Ah-ha!  Now I can look for candles,
	matches, and the liquor cabinet.

		JOEL
	I think we should go.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, it's our house!  Just tonight --

		 counter)
	-- we're David and Ruth Laskin.  Which
	one do you want to be?  I prefer to be
	Ruth but I'm flexible.

	Alcohol!  You make drinks.  I'm going
	find the bedroom and slip into something
	more Ruth.  I'm ruthless at the moment.

She runs upstairs, giggling.  The room is drying out, turning
into a husk.

		JOEL
		(calling after her)
	I really should go.  I really need to
	catch my ride.

		VOICE-OVER
	I didn't want to go.  I was too nervous.
	I thought, maybe you were a nut.  But you
	were exciting.  You called from upstairs.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
		(flat)
	So go.

		JOEL
	I did.  I walked out the door.  I felt
	like I was a scared little kid.  I
	thought you knew that about me.  I ran
	back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my
	humiliation.  You said, ""so go"" with such
	disdain.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
		(poking her head downstairs)
	What if you stay this time?

		JOEL
	I walked out the door.  There's no more
	memory.

		CLEMENTINE
	Come back and make up a good-bye at
	least.  Let's pretend we had one.

Clementine comes downstairs, vague and robotic, making her
way through the decaying environment.

	Bye, Joel.

		JOEL
	I love you.

She smiles.  They kiss.  It fades.

		CLEMENTINE
	I --","The scene begins with Joel and Clementine entering a dark house, with Joel looking nervous. Clementine teases him, and they begin to search the house for candles and alcohol.

	Did you have fun?

Joel nods glumly.

Carrie continues to talk, but her voice goes under as Joel
studies the faded husks of memories, piled like refuse
outside the moving car window.  He sees dried-out version of
previous interactions with Clementine playing out in loops.

beach with Rob and Carrie.  It, too, is decaying.  Soon all
has crumbled into dust.  Everything goes black.","Joel is in the back seat of a car with Rob and Carrie in the front.

reaches for his hand and gently pulls him down.  He lies on
his back beside her, their bodies touching.  He wants to turn
to her, but out of shyness, doesn't.  She holds his hand.

and snuggles closer to him.

	Make love?
